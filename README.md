#**WeLoveMovies App**

###WeLoveMovies is an app that displays and filters movies by theater.  It was intended as an back-end educational exercise, and with a few tweaks could display live data from theaters around the country. This repository is the back-end of the full WeLoveMovies. The client can be found [here](https://github.com/nickrizzo76/WeLoveMovies-Client).
